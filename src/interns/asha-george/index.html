      <p>Hello,</p>
      <p> My name is Asha George. I am a mom and a software developer. I live in the South Bay. The picture is a picturesque view which I took while I was hiking on the Mission Peak Trail. The picture is a tribute to my love for nature and the gorgeous outdoors we have here. </p>
      <p> I am delighted to be applying to be an intern at Lob. I am trying to return back to work after a gap. In my previous life, I have been a Senior Engineer who built applications and algorithms. After the break, I upskilled myself by going through Hack Reactor. </p>
      <p>I like to code because I like to solve problems and pick my brain. I like to build web applications using JavaScript, React, HTML and CSS. I have also dabbled in data analysis and visualization using Python.</p>
      <p> I am still learning and would love to contribute to Lob as an intern and join the femengineers there. BTW, I had a great time doing this refreshing challenge. Thank you, </p>
      <p>Asha</p>
